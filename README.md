# Kidney_Stone_Detection_Using_YOLOv7
This project presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting kidney stones in ultrasound images using the YOLOv7 object detection model. The goal is to develop a fast, reliable tool to assist radiologists in identifying kidney stones in noisy and low-contrast ultrasound scans.

The model is trained on a custom-annotated dataset of kidney ultrasound images with labeled stone regions. YOLOv7's real-time detection capabilities and high precision make it a suitable choice for medical imaging tasks, particularly where early and accurate diagnosis is critical.

ðŸ“„ This work was developed as part of a research study focused on applying real-time object detection models to medical diagnostics.
